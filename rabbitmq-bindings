# Plugin to monitor the number of bindings to RabbitMQ
#
# Usage: Link or copy into /etc/munin/node.d/
#
# Parameters
#     env.conn_warn <warning bindings>
#     env.conn_crit <critical bindings>
#
# Magic markers (optional - only used by munin-config and some
# installation scripts):
#
#%# family=auto
#%# capabilities=autoconf

# If run with the "autoconf"-parameter, give our opinion on wether we
# should be run on this system or not. This is optinal, and only used by
# munin-config. In the case of this plugin, we should most probably
# always be included.

# If run with the "config"-parameter, give out information on how the
# graphs should look.

        CONN_CRIT=${binding_crit:-1000}
